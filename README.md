## **Contents**

### **1. Code 1: Simple Linear Regression**
- **Features:**
  - Data loading and exploration (`train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets).
  - Data cleaning: Handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
  - Visualization: Scatter plots to observe relationships between variables.
  - Model building: Using `sklearn` to train and test a linear regression model.
  - Prediction and evaluation: Generating predictions and visualizing results.

### **2. Code 2: Linear Regression with Real-World Dataset**
- **Dataset:** `Ecommerce Customers.csv`
- **Objective:** Predict yearly customer spending based on key features:
  - Average session length.
  - Time spent on app.
  - Membership duration.
- **Workflow:**
  - Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing features.
  - Correlation analysis: Identifying significant relationships.
  - Model training: Building and testing a regression model.
  - Evaluation: Metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE for performance analysis.
